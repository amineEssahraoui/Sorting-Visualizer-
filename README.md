Sorting-Visualizer
A dynamic and interactive way to explore sorting algorithms in action. Watch how different algorithms process and organize data step by step, revealing their efficiency and behavior through real-time visualization. Compare performance, understand complexity, and gain deeper insights into sorting techniques through engaging animations.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Custom Input: Enter your own numbers to visualize their sorting process.
âœ… Random Generation: Generate a random dataset to test different algorithms.
âœ… Sorting Control: Start and stop the sorting process anytime using the Start and Stop buttons.
âœ… Speed Adjustment: Modify sorting speed, especially useful for large datasets.
âœ… Algorithm Selection: Choose from multiple sorting algorithms:

Algorithm	Average Complexity	Worst-Case Complexity
Bubble Sort	O(nÂ²)	O(nÂ²)
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)
Insertion Sort	O(nÂ²)	O(nÂ²)
Selection Sort	O(nÂ²)	O(nÂ²)
Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(nÂ²) (rare cases)
ðŸš€ Purpose
This project aims to provide a better understanding of sorting algorithms through a visual and interactive approach, allowing users to analyze their performance based on the number of elements being sorted.
